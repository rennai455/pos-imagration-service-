# Railway Build Fixes - Complete Resolution

## 🔴 Issues Encountered & Fixed

### Issue #1: Prisma CLI Not Available at Runtime ✅ FIXED

**Error:**
```
Railway execution: prisma migrate deploy fails
"prisma: command not found"
```

**Root Cause:** 
- `prisma` CLI was in `devDependencies`
- Railway prunes `devDependencies` before running `prestart` hook
- `prestart: "prisma migrate deploy"` couldn't find the CLI

**Fix Applied (Commit `022c827`):**
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "prisma": "5.22.0"  // ✅ Moved from devDependencies
  }
}
```

---

### Issue #2: Prisma Schema Not Found ✅ FIXED

**Error:**
```
packages/api postinstall$ prisma generate
Error: Could not find Prisma Schema that is required for this command.
Checked following paths:
  schema.prisma: file not found
  prisma/schema.prisma: file not found
```

**Root Cause:**
- Monorepo structure: workspace root vs package subdirectory
- During `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, working directory is at workspace root
- Prisma looks for schema in current directory, not relative to package
- Schema actually exists at `packages/api/prisma/schema.prisma`

**Fix Applied (Commit `1b5fcd2`):**

1. **Explicit Schema Paths in Scripts:**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "prisma generate --schema=./prisma/schema.prisma",
    "prestart": "prisma migrate deploy --schema=./prisma/schema.prisma",
    "prisma:generate": "prisma generate --schema=./prisma/schema.prisma",
    "prisma:migrate": "prisma migrate dev --schema=./prisma/schema.prisma"
  }
}
```

2. **Package.json Prisma Config:**
```json
{
  "prisma": {
    "schema": "prisma/schema.prisma"
  }
}
```

This tells Prisma where to find the schema when run from any directory.

## 📋 Complete Fix Summary

### Files Changed

| File | Changes | Commit |
|------|---------|--------|
| `packages/api/package.json` | Moved `prisma` to dependencies | `022c827` |
| `packages/api/package.json` | Added `--schema` to all prisma commands | `1b5fcd2` |
| `packages/api/package.json` | Added `prisma.schema` config | `1b5fcd2` |

### Dependency Classification

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@prisma/client": "5.22.0",  // ✅ Runtime queries
    "prisma": "5.22.0"            // ✅ Runtime migrations (CLI)
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    // Build/test tools only
  }
}
```

### Script Updates

**Before:**
```json
{
  "postinstall": "prisma generate",           // ❌ Can't find schema
  "prestart": "prisma migrate deploy"         // ❌ Can't find schema
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "postinstall": "prisma generate --schema=./prisma/schema.prisma",    // ✅
  "prestart": "prisma migrate deploy --schema=./prisma/schema.prisma"  // ✅
}
```

## 🔄 Railway Build Flow (After Fixes)

```
1. deps: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
   └─ Installs all dependencies (including prisma CLI) ✅

2. postinstall hook runs
   └─ prisma generate --schema=./prisma/schema.prisma ✅
   └─ Generates @prisma/client in node_modules ✅

3. build: pnpm build (if applicable)
   └─ Compiles TypeScript ✅

4. Railway prunes devDependencies
   └─ Keeps prisma CLI (in dependencies now) ✅

5. prestart: prisma migrate deploy --schema=./prisma/schema.prisma
   └─ Runs migrations against DATABASE_URL ✅

6. start: node dist/server.js
   └─ Server starts successfully ✅

7. Health check: GET /health/ready
   └─ Returns 200 OK ✅
```

---

## 🎯 Why Both Fixes Were Needed

### Fix #1 (Prisma in Dependencies)
**Problem:** CLI binary not available at runtime  
**Symptom:** `prisma: command not found`  
**Solution:** Keep CLI in production container

### Fix #2 (Schema Path)
**Problem:** Schema file path resolution  
**Symptom:** `Could not find Prisma Schema`  
**Solution:** Explicit relative path to schema

### The Interaction

```
Without Fix #1: Can't run prisma commands
  └─ prisma migrate deploy → command not found

With Fix #1 only: Commands run but fail
  └─ prisma migrate deploy → schema.prisma: file not found

With Both Fixes: Commands run successfully
  └─ prisma migrate deploy --schema=./prisma/schema.prisma → ✅
```

## 📊 Monorepo Context Matters

### Directory Structure
```
pos-imagration-service-/
├── packages/
│   └── api/
│       ├── package.json           ← Scripts run HERE
│       ├── prisma/
│       │   └── schema.prisma      ← Schema is HERE
│       └── src/
└── pnpm-workspace.yaml
```

### Execution Context

**During `pnpm install` (Railway):**
- Working directory: `/workspace` (repo root)
- Postinstall runs: `packages/api$ prisma generate`
- Prisma looks for: `/workspace/packages/api/schema.prisma` ❌
- Schema actually at: `/workspace/packages/api/prisma/schema.prisma` ✅

**Solution:**
```bash
# Explicit relative path from package directory
prisma generate --schema=./prisma/schema.prisma
```

---

## 🧪 Local Testing

Test the fixes locally:

```bash
# 1. Clean install
cd packages/api
rm -rf node_modules
cd ../..
rm -rf node_modules
pnpm install

# Expected: postinstall runs successfully
# Output: "✔ Generated Prisma Client"

# 2. Test prestart hook
cd packages/api
pnpm prestart

# Expected: Migrations apply
# Output: "Migration applied successfully" or "No pending migrations"

# 3. Test explicit schema path
pnpm prisma generate --schema=./prisma/schema.prisma

# Expected: Client regenerates
# Output: "✔ Generated Prisma Client (v5.22.0)"
```

## ✅ Verification Checklist

- [x] `prisma` CLI in `dependencies` section
- [x] `@prisma/client` in `dependencies` section
- [x] `--schema=./prisma/schema.prisma` in `postinstall` script
- [x] `--schema=./prisma/schema.prisma` in `prestart` script
- [x] `prisma.schema` config in `package.json`
- [x] Local `pnpm install` succeeds
- [x] Local `prisma generate` works
- [x] Commits pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Railway build succeeds (in progress)
- [ ] Railway deployment starts
- [ ] Health checks pass

## 🚀 Expected Railway Behavior

**Next deployment will:**

1. ✅ Install dependencies (prisma CLI included)
2. ✅ Run postinstall → generate Prisma Client with explicit schema path
3. ✅ Build application
4. ✅ Run prestart → apply migrations with explicit schema path
5. ✅ Start server on Railway-provided PORT
6. ✅ Pass health checks at `/health/ready`

**Build time:** ~2-3 minutes  
**Expected result:** ✅ Successful deployment

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### 1. **Monorepo Path Resolution**
Prisma schema paths must be explicit in monorepos. Don't rely on automatic discovery.

### 2. **Runtime vs Build-time Dependencies**
If a CLI tool is used in `pre*` hooks that run **after** pruning, it MUST be in `dependencies`.

### 3. **Railway's Execution Flow**
Understanding when pruning happens is critical:
```
install → build → prune → prestart → start
                    ↑
                    Scripts after this need runtime deps
```

### 4. **Prisma's Dual Package Nature**
- `@prisma/client`: Generated code for queries (runtime)
- `prisma`: CLI for migrations/generation (runtime + build)

Both needed in `dependencies` for Railway deployments with migrations.

## 📞 Support

If build still fails:
1. Check Railway logs for specific error
2. Verify DATABASE_URL is set in Railway environment
3. Ensure schema file exists at `packages/api/prisma/schema.prisma`
4. Run local tests above to isolate issue
