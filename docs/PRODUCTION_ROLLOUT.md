# Production Rollout Plan

## Pre-deployment Tasks

### 1. Infrastructure Validation
- [ ] Database backup completed
- [ ] Database migrations tested on staging
- [ ] Staging environment matches production configuration
- [ ] CDN configuration verified
- [ ] SSL certificates valid and up to date

### 2. Application Readiness
- [ ] All integration tests passing
- [ ] Performance tests completed
- [ ] Security scans completed
- [ ] Dependencies up to date
- [ ] Documentation updated

### 3. Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Prometheus metrics configured
- [ ] Grafana dashboards ready
- [ ] Alert rules configured
- [ ] Log aggregation verified
- [ ] Error tracking active

## Deployment Process

### 1. Pre-deployment Communication
- [ ] Notify stakeholders of deployment window
- [ ] Confirm on-call support availability
- [ ] Review rollback procedures with team
- [ ] Update status page

### 2. Database Updates
- [ ] Take full database backup
- [ ] Verify backup integrity
- [ ] Apply schema migrations
- [ ] Verify data integrity

### 3. Application Deployment
- [ ] Scale down background workers
- [ ] Deploy new version to 10% of instances
- [ ] Monitor error rates for 15 minutes
- [ ] Deploy to remaining instances
- [ ] Scale up background workers

### 4. Post-deployment Verification
- [ ] Health checks passing
- [ ] Metrics reporting correctly
- [ ] Sample transactions successful
- [ ] Background jobs processing
- [ ] No unexpected errors in logs

## Rollback Triggers

Initiate rollback if:
- Error rate exceeds 1% for 5 minutes
- P95 latency exceeds 1 second
- Critical business flows failing
- Security vulnerability detected
- Data integrity issues observed

## Rollback Process

1. Immediate Actions:
   - Stop deployment if in progress
   - Scale up previous version
   - Direct traffic to previous version
   - Notify stakeholders

2. Database Rollback:
   - Restore from pre-deployment backup if needed
   - Verify data integrity
   - Run validation queries

3. Post-Rollback:
   - Verify system health
   - Update status page
   - Schedule incident review

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Zero downtime during deployment
- [ ] No increase in error rates
- [ ] Response times within SLA
- [ ] All critical flows functional
- [ ] Monitoring systems healthy
- [ ] Background jobs processing normally

## Post-deployment Tasks

### 1. Monitoring (24 hours)
- [ ] Watch error rates
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Check database performance
- [ ] Verify background job completion
- [ ] Monitor resource usage

### 2. Documentation
- [ ] Update runbooks if needed
- [ ] Document any deployment issues
- [ ] Update architecture diagrams
- [ ] Record deployment metrics

### 3. Review
- [ ] Schedule deployment retrospective
- [ ] Collect feedback from team
- [ ] Update deployment process
- [ ] Document lessons learned
